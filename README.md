# DebtVault - Decentralized P2P Lending Platform

A cutting-edge peer-to-peer lending protocol on Hemi Network where loans are represented as tradeable NFTs, enabling a secondary market for debt instruments while maintaining borrower accountability.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite  
**Blockchain**: Hemi Network (Chain ID: 43111)  
**Smart Contract**: `0x72F6185DcBb9c8415f01003ACc872f08B44FC292`  
**Wallet Integration**: RainbowKit + Wagmi  
**State Management**: TanStack Query with intelligent caching  

## üéØ Core Features

### Credit Line System
- **Personalized Credit**: Lenders configure custom borrowing limits and APR ranges per borrower/token pair
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: APR varies with utilization using linear interpolation between min/max rates
- **Token-Specific Terms**: Each ERC20 token has independent credit configurations
- **Credit Isolation**: Lender/borrower/token combinations maintain separate credit terms

### NFT-Based Loans
- **ERC721 Loan Tokens**: Every loan becomes a tradeable NFT upon creation
- **Secondary Market**: NFT owners can trade loan positions while preserving borrower obligations
- **Dual Identity System**: Original borrower remains tied to credit utilization; current NFT owner handles repayment
- **Transfer Safety**: NFT transfers cannot manipulate credit utilization or bypass loan limits

### Interest & Repayment Model
- **Simple Interest**: `Interest = (principal √ó APR √ó days) √∑ (365 √ó 10000)`
- **APR Range**: 0.01% to 100% annually (1-10000 basis points)
- **Flexible Repayment**: No maturity dates or liquidations - borrowers control timing
- **Utilization-Based Pricing**: Higher credit utilization leads to higher interest rates

### Lender Tools
- **Liquidity Pool**: Deposit tokens to enable automated lending
- **Credit Line Management**: Set borrowing limits and interest rate ranges
- **Principal Forgiveness**: Option to forgive outstanding principal amounts
- **Interest Forgiveness**: Reset accrued interest on active loans

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: All external calls use CEI pattern with nonReentrant guards
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe arithmetic for all interest calculations
- **Anti-Spam Protection**: Global loan count limits prevent DoS attacks
- **Standard ERC20 Only**: No support for fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens

## üí∞ Economic Model

- **Zero Platform Fees**: Pure peer-to-peer lending without protocol revenue
- **Utilization-Based Pricing**: Interest rates increase with borrowing activity
- **Market-Driven Rates**: Lenders compete by offering attractive terms
- **NFT Liquidity Premium**: Secondary market enables instant loan position exits
