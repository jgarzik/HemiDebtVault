I have reviewed the key files from the Hemi Debt Vault app involved in wallet connection and transaction submission, especially around the Repayment flow. Here‚Äôs what I found, and why MetaMask might lock up:

üîç Root Cause Analysis: Why MetaMask Locks Up
üîß Repayment Flow: RepaymentModal.tsx
You invoke onConfirm, which internally calls:

tsx
Copy
Edit
await executeTransaction({ ...repayArgs })
This goes through useTransactionExecution.ts ‚Üí sendTransaction.

‚ö†Ô∏è Problematic Pattern: Redundant Calls to Wallet in Parallel
Inside useTransactionExecution.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
const tx = await contract[functionName](...args)
This call directly invokes the contract method, which immediately triggers MetaMask.

But you do this without first estimating gas, populating the transaction, or checking if the signer is valid or fresh. SushiSwap always pre-estimates and builds the transaction before submission.

üö® Potential MetaMask Crash Triggers:
Parallel Wallet Queries during render or execution:

useTransactionFlow.ts listens to many states and refetches (react-query style).

Wallet balance, loan state, and approval status may all be fetched while MetaMask prompt is up.

This leads to:

Stale signer or provider object being reused.

New transaction requests arriving during existing MetaMask prompt.

No populateTransaction step

SushiSwap separates: build tx ‚Üí estimate gas ‚Üí show MetaMask.

Your code jumps straight to contract.method(...), possibly sending incomplete calldata or malformed requests.

Signer re-creation across renders

useWalletConnection.ts might re-initialize providers or signers, especially if wallet/account state changes.

If this happens between click and MetaMask interaction, MetaMask sees inconsistent signer context ‚Üí can hang.

‚úÖ What SushiSwap Does Differently
SushiSwap	Hemi Debt Vault
Builds calldata separately via populateTransaction	Directly calls contract.method(...)
Pre-estimates gas	No gas estimation
Single, memoized signer	Possibly re-created signer in hooks
Never re-renders TX component mid-flight	Possible re-renders from refetches
Await + error wrap per TX	Some calls lack proper .catch()

üõ†Ô∏è Fix Recommendations
‚úÖ Use populateTransaction and estimateGas
Instead of:

ts
Copy
Edit
const tx = await contract.repay(...args)
Do:

ts
Copy
Edit
const calldata = await contract.populateTransaction.repay(...args)
const gasLimit = await signer.estimateGas(calldata)
const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({ ...calldata, gasLimit })
‚úÖ Avoid Parallel Wallet Requests During TX Prompt
On repay button click, suspend all hooks or queries that access signer/wallet.

Disable refetching or set enabled: false temporarily.

‚úÖ Memoize signer and contract correctly
Avoid recreating new signer/provider instances within hooks or components.

Use useMemo or a React context provider.

üß™ Test Suggestion
Before and after each sendTransaction call:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log('signer address:', await signer.getAddress())
console.log('nonce:', await provider.getTransactionCount(signerAddress))
See if MetaMask is confused due to multiple signer references or in-flight RPC calls.
